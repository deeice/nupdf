===README--please read this file from start to finish, before asking any questions about the program===

nupdf is a small, relatively fast pdf reader for the dingoo-a320/a330(running dingux), ben nanonote, and in theory any other system (assuming the libraries can be compiled of course, minor changes may be needed).
It uses the open source mupdf library to handle all pdf operations, and SDL to display/for the UI.
nupdf also uses SDL_picofont for the menutext

==keybindings==
=nanonote=
pan: up/down/left/right
zoom in:o
zoom out:l
previous page:i
next page:p
toggle page rotation:q
fine panning:a+dpad
forward/back 5 pages:a+p/i
menu:enter (right/left/o/l to increase/decrease page number, a to select)
exit:escape

=dingoo-a320=
pan: up/down/left/right
previous page:left shoulder

toggle page rotation:y
zoom in:x
zoom out:b
fine panning:a+dpad
forward/back 5 pages:a+shoulder buttons

exit:select

==Installation==
=dingoo=
place nupdf.dge, and the data folder on the sd card (e.g /local/nupdf), and launch it as you would any other program (it requires a filename, so use the 'rom chooser' functionality of your menu, to give it a pdf file)

=nanonote=
place nupdf, and the data folder onto the filesystem(doesn't really matter where), and type:
./nupdf foo.pdf
